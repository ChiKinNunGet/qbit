Practice/review of python and quantum computing, specifically for superconducting qubit architecture.
Practice based on play around with and replicating results, charts, and simulations of examples from the following articles:

Demo/program ideas
single qubit
relaxation/decay (T1, T2, T2*) noise -> ramsey interferometry, hahn spin echo demo
lindblad qubit-environment interaction
two/multi qubit entanglement & multiqubit gates

rebuild bottom up with noisy qubits
generalized qubits with realistic coupling behavior 
    capacitative coupling/pulses for x,y control and virtual z gate with pulse phase
    iswap gate, then cphase with higher levels
bigger circuits
