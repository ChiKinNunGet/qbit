Practice/review of python and quantum computing, specifically for superconducting qubit architecture.  
    Much guidance taken from UChicago MENG 31400 (Advanced Quantum Engineering) taught by Prof. Tian Zhong
Practice based on play around with and replicating results, charts, and simulations of examples from the following articles:

* single qubit  
* relaxation/decay (T1, T2, T2*) noise -> ramsey interferometry, hahn spin echo demo  
* live precession + qubit driving (x/y rotation in rotating frame)
lindblad qubit-environment interaction  
two/multi qubit entanglement & multiqubit gates
